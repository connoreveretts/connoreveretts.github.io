                My journey at Bon App√©tit at Willamette started in March 2022 as a Line Cook, and I was quickly promoted to the Catering Department in less than half a year. By the one-year mark, I had ascended into a leadership position, being promoted to Student Coordinator. In this position, I am responsible for the recruitment, interviewing, and scheduling of staff, as well as managing and assessing employee records to improve staff productivity for a team of over 60 employees. Through effective data management, I've succeeded in reducing labor costs and elevating the company's output quality and efficiency. This quick progression in my career highlights my strong leadership skills and dedication to achieving operational excellence.
